# Daily Highlights

Write down daily highlights and save them in the browser's local storage.

### Short

This is a simple Elm application allowing to save some highlights from today,
thoughts, results which are worth noting and other interesting stuff.

First, proof-of-concept version, allows saving these in the browser's local storage.
I plan for abstracting it out to allow saving the thoughts anywhere.

### Running

Start Elm reactor

```
$ elm reactor
```

and navigate to `src/App.elm`.
